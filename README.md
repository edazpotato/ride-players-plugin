# Ride Players!
### Minecraft: Java Edition version: 1.16.5

This is a plugin that lets you ride on other players' shoulders by right-clicking them.
To dismount, just use <kbd>LeftShift</kbd> like you would normaly use for dismounting a horse or boat.

You can kick people off of you by using the `/kickpassengers` command, which has some aliases.

This plugin was made for and tested on PaperMC 1.16.5, but it should work fine on Bukkit and Spigot servers too!
